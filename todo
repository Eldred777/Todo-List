# Todo list for todo-list
## Plan
MVP without nesting. 
Then add nesting. 
Then see where it goes from there.

## For a MVP
- DONE: write and load .db plaintext file
- sublists 
- pretty print lists 
- context manager --- able to go into a sublist and add new todo without needing to 
- HALF-DONE: add new todo, need to come back to this when sublists have been implemented
- HALF-DONE: remove easily, even from within further trees --- maybe syntax like (remove :list :sublist :reminder) 
- undo

## further ideas 
- edit todo --- maybe i need to give every todo a unique identifier? Alternatively just remove and add again.
- CLI instead of needing to exist inside the lisp image? would require lots of testing first
    - pretty colours, maybe see [link](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/os.html)
    - compile to executable
- GUI in addition to/instead of CLI, possibly [tk?](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/gui.html)
- mark as done instead of just deleting
- priority of todo items
